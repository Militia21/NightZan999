### Hello there
So this is me NightZan999, and I like to code. Well I don't, I just like the results which is why I do it. 
I joined github in 2019 and yeah ever since then my life has changed. I star a ton of repositories and work quite well with github.

I code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP and NodeJS. I sometimes code in Java and Ruby because Ruby is very similar to python and java to PHP. 
I like making websites and have some good websites, which are made in HTML, CSS, SCSS and JS. I use NodeJS for backend and have made authentication with PHP.

🎉 I have discord, NightZan999#0194. 
✨ I made discord bots and use game engines like Unity (learning C#)
👍 Would appreciate you starring my projects or atleast check my projects out! I am gonna code more in 2021, like code PHP or Java. 

🎫 And yes unlike others I like [jetbrains products](https://jetbrains.com) better than VS Code for its specific language.
Like: 
```js
Pycharm > VS Code for Python // returns true
PHPStorm > VS Code for PHP // returns true
```
But Visual Studio Code as a **full IDE is better than any one Jetbrain products. Which is why I use that as my main IDE :)**
