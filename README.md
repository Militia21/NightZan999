### Hello there
I am willing to work on any project where I could get paid by Discord Nitro (10 USD).

<details>
  <summary>The IDE / Text-Editor I use? </summary>
    ðŸŽ« And yes unlike others I like [jetbrains products](https://jetbrains.com) better than VS Code for its specific language. <br>
    But Visual Studio Code as a **full IDE is better than any one Jetbrain products. Which is why I use that as my main text editor :)**
