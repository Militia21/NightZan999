### Hello there
So this is me NightZan999, and I like to code. Well I don't, I just like the results which is why I do it. 
I joined github in 2019 and yeah ever since then my life has changed. I star a ton of repositories and work quite well with github.
I like automation and like good projects. 

I am working on a discord bot, will soon be working on an eccomerce website with PHP. My favorite language is between python, javascript and php. 
I am learning C#, Java and C++.

ðŸŽ‰ I have discord, NightZan999#0194. 
âœ¨ I made discord bots and use game engines like Unity (learning C#)

ðŸŽ« And yes unlike others I like [jetbrains products](https://jetbrains.com) better than VS Code for its specific language.
Like: 
```js
Pycharm > VS Code for Python // returns true
PHPStorm > VS Code for PHP // returns true
```
But Visual Studio Code as a **full IDE is better than any one Jetbrain products. Which is why I use that as my main IDE :)**
