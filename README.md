### Hello there
I am willing to work on any project where I could get paid by Discord Nitro (10 USD). 
Here are the languages I know:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS
4. NodeJS
5. PHP
6. Python
7. Java (kinda, only basics)

ðŸŽ‰ I have discord, NightZan999#0194. 
âœ¨ I made discord bots and use game engines like Unity (learning C#)

ðŸŽ« And yes unlike others I like [jetbrains products](https://jetbrains.com) better than VS Code for its specific language.
But Visual Studio Code as a **full IDE is better than any one Jetbrain products. Which is why I use that as my main text editor :)**
#### Here are some cool stats
